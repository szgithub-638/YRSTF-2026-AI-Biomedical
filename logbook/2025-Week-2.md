# Logbook — Week 2

**Focus:** Project selection and research definition

## Decisions Made
- Selected an AI + biomedical project focused on non-contact heart rate and emotion estimation
- Chose an app-based approach using webcam video
- Avoided invasive sensors or medical diagnosis claims

## Research Question
How accurately can an AI-based, webcam system estimate heart rate and emotional state compared to baseline measurements, and how could this technology support early stress awareness?

## Rationale
This project combines artificial intelligence with biomedical signal processing while remaining ethical, accessible, and impactful. It addresses stress awareness and mental well-being without replacing medical professionals.

## Next Steps
- Set up research board
- Begin background research on rPPG and emotion recognition
- Draft ethics statement
