# Logbook — Week 1

**Date:** [2025/12/27]  
**Project:** YRSTF 2026 — AI & Biomedical Engineering  
**Focus:** Project setup and tooling

## What I did
- Installed and configured Git properly on Windows
- Set up a professional project folder structure
- Initialized Git repository
- Created logbook and documentation system
- Made first commit and pushed project to GitHub

## Why this matters
A clear and organized development process is essential for scientific integrity,
version control, and reproducibility. This structure will support research,
ethics documentation, model development, and application deployment.

## Challenges
- Initial Git setup on Windows required careful configuration
- Understanding Git workflow (local vs remote repositories)

## Next steps
- Finalize project title and research question
- Select final biomedical + AI focus
- Begin background research and ethics review
