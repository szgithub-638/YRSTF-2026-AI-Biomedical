# Week 3 Logbook – Problem Definition & Project Direction

## 1. Problem Being Addressed
Stress and emotional overload often go unnoticed because most monitoring tools require wearable devices, medical access, or self-reporting. Many people, especially students, do not consistently use these tools, which means early signs of stress are often missed.

## 2. Why Existing Solutions Are Limited
Most current solutions rely on:
- Wearable devices, which are expensive and not always worn
- Self-reporting, which can be inaccurate
- Clinical equipment, which is not accessible to everyone

This creates a gap for a low-cost, contactless, and accessible solution.

## 3. Proposed Solution
My project aims to build a web-based application that uses a standard webcam to estimate heart rate by analyzing subtle changes in facial skin color (rPPG). The system provides users with physiological awareness rather than medical diagnosis.

## 4. Scientific Concept: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG)
Remote photoplethysmography is a computer vision technique that estimates heart rate by detecting small changes in skin color caused by blood flow during each heartbeat. These changes are invisible to the human eye but can be detected using a camera and signal processing techniques.

## 5. Project Scope and Limitations
This project:
- Does NOT diagnose medical or mental health conditions
- Does NOT store biometric data
- Is intended for educational and awareness purposes only

Accuracy may be affected by lighting conditions, movement, and camera quality.
